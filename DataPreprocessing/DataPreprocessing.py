import csv
'''
Usage:
    1. Provide new data into RawData.csv (see format requirements below).
    2. Run this script.
    3. Work with processed data.

Raw data should be CSV file with answers sorted by time
Use this query for obtain it form MySQL table:
    SELECT
        id_year,
        year.name, 
        answer.id_team, 
        team.name,
        task.type,
        ((date_format(answer.inserted, '%H')-15)*60 + date_format(answer.inserted, '%i')) AS minutes,
        answer.id_answer,
        answer.inserted,
        IF(answer.code = task.code, "TRUE", "FALSE") AS correct,
        answer.id_task,
        IF(answer.code != task.code,
            0,
            1000-(
                SELECT
                    COUNT(help.id_answer)
                FROM answer AS help
                WHERE
                    help.code = task.code AND 
                    help.inserted < answer.inserted AND 
                    help.id_task = answer.id_task
            )
        ) AS score
    FROM answer
    INNER JOIN task USING(id_task)
    INNER JOIN team USING (id_team)
    INNER JOIN year USING (id_year)
    ORDER BY id_year, minutes, id_answer
    
So one row is:
    0 -> ï»¿id_year
    1 -> name of year
    2 -> id_team
    3 -> name of team
    4 -> task type
    5 -> minutes from beginning
    6 -> id_answer
    7 -> inserted
    8 -> correct
    9 -> id_task
    10 -> score
